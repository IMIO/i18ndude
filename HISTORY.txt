i18ndude 0.6 - released July 4, 2005

    - tagged and released 0.6
      [batlogg]

    - pystring: add 'addPortalMessage' to the list of python functions whose
      argument should be translated. This allows to catch the new-style portal-
      messages in Plone 2.1 to be automagically extracted
      [hannosch]

i18ndude 0.5 - released June 14, 2005

    - tagged and released 0.5
      [batlogg]

    - as html-entities in msgstr's are bad, don't provide them in the original
      comments. this has confused translators.
      [hannosch]

    - untranslated.py: Added a new handler available through a command line
      switch, generally ignore text in script and style tags
      [hannosch]

    - Fixed whitespace error in generation of #, fuzzy comments
      [hannosch]

    - i18ndude now takes a second pot to merge in the merge and rebuild-pot
      commands, this is useful if you have both a manual.pot and a generated.pot
      [hannosch]

    - catalog.py (MessageCatalog) added a new method addToSameFileName() which
      adds in a msgid but adds the excerpt to an existing filename occurrence
      This is used in i18ngenerator.py of PloneTranslations to add in actions
      like "Edit" as msgids and adds all types these are definied to the same
      occurrence rather than generating a new one for each type
      [hannosch]

    - catalog.py (POWriter.write) takes a new argument noMoreComments that
      supresses the "## xx More..." comments
      [hannosch]

    - Also fill in the Original comments when parsing i18n:attributes
      This allows for efficient handling of named i18n:attributes
      [hannosch]

    - Refactored the English Translation stuff and renamed it to Original
      [hannosch]

    - When syncing po-files the old and new original comments are compared and
      the msgid is set to fuzzy if these aren't the same, meaning the msgid has
      changed and needs some verification
      [hannosch]

    - Added optional allcomments argument and get_original() method
      These are used in the latest PloneTranslations tests to compare
      the original value of a msgid with the msgstr
      [hannosch]

    - Set chart width to 1000px. Plone has too many translations ;)
      [hannosch]

    - Included a new option to scan python scripts for messages.
      Currently it looks for the _(), translate() and uranslate()
      functions. It is based on pygettext.py from Python and some
      ideas taken from Zope's extract.py.
      [hannosch]

    - catalog.py (POWriter._print_entry): Added a second # to "English
      translation" lines so that those lines don't get written out twice.
      Which happens because we try to preserve comments.
