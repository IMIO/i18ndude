      [hannosch]

i18ndude 2.0 - released October 9, 2005

    - Removed two unsupported scripts, if you have used them please tell me
      [hannosch]

    - Refactored sync option into function of catalog.py and wrote test for it.
      Fixing a bug along the way and did some code cleanup.
      [hannosch]

    - Added option to specify title of chart explicitly
      [hannosch]

    - Added combinedchart option, which is used to build the overview charts
      on plone.org for a comprehensive view on the status of translations.
      [hannosch]

    - Removed the extract literals feature. If anybody needs it, please speak up.
      [hannosch]

    - Updated visualisation.py to handle new internal catalog format.
      Provided basic test for it.
      [hannosch]

    - Added new feature to PTReader. For msgid's which are already in the
      catalog, check if the msgstr matches or provide an error message.
      [hannosch]

    - Fixed another issue regarding missing whitespace and provided test for it
      [hannosch, Tuttle]

    - POWriter generates new default comments instead of the old original
      comments. POParser automatically converts existing original comments
      (# Original: "") or Zope3-style default comments (# Default: "") at the
      reading step to new default comments (#. Default: "").

    - PTReader now doesn't extracts any excerpts anymore.
      [hannosch]

    - Removed the silent option on rebuilt, merge and sync completly. The
      addition of the added- and removed-sections lead to an incorrect format.
      Use a normal diff tool if you are really interessted in this information.
      [hannosch]

    - PYReader now extracts the line numbers of messages and writes these at
      the end of the reference seperated with a ':'
      [hannosch]

    - The catalog's add method doesn't adds duplicate references or automatic
      comments anymore. Test were updated to reflect new behaviour.
      [hannosch]

    - Fixed handling of normal comments in PT- and PYReader.
      [hannosch]

    - Always add a blank line as the last line on po's, as poEdit does it
      [hannosch]

    - Adjusted Python parsing tests to cover the current behaviour. Added XXX
      comments where it is wrong
      [hannosch]

    - Fixed an issue with an unnecessary whitespace and provided test for it
      [hannosch, Tuttle]

    - Based all of catalog.py on the new MessageEntry class.
      Rewrote POWriter to use new gettext standard conform output.
      [hannosch]

    - This is the last release with old-stlye output formatting and command line

      (lines starting with #: without corresponding #. lines)
      [hannosch]

    - added test infrastructure and tests for po file parsing
      [hannosch]

      [hannosch]

i18ndude 0.6 - released July 4, 2005

    - tagged and released 0.6
      [batlogg]

    - pystring: add 'addPortalMessage' to the list of python functions whose
      argument should be translated. This allows to catch the new-style portal-
      messages in Plone 2.1 to be automagically extracted
      [hannosch]

i18ndude 0.5 - released June 14, 2005

    - tagged and released 0.5
      [batlogg]

    - as html-entities in msgstr's are bad, don't provide them in the original
      comments. this has confused translators.
      [hannosch]

    - untranslated.py: Added a new handler available through a command line
      switch, generally ignore text in script and style tags
      [hannosch]

    - Fixed whitespace error in generation of #, fuzzy comments
      [hannosch]

    - i18ndude now takes a second pot to merge in the merge and rebuild-pot
      commands, this is useful if you have both a manual.pot and a generated.pot
      [hannosch]

    - catalog.py (MessageCatalog) added a new method addToSameFileName() which
      adds in a msgid but adds the excerpt to an existing filename occurrence
      This is used in i18ngenerator.py of PloneTranslations to add in actions
      like "Edit" as msgids and adds all types these are definied to the same
      occurrence rather than generating a new one for each type
      [hannosch]

    - catalog.py (POWriter.write) takes a new argument noMoreComments that
      supresses the "## xx More..." comments
      [hannosch]

    - Also fill in the Original comments when parsing i18n:attributes
      This allows for efficient handling of named i18n:attributes
      [hannosch]

    - Refactored the English Translation stuff and renamed it to Original
      [hannosch]

    - When syncing po-files the old and new original comments are compared and
      the msgid is set to fuzzy if these aren't the same, meaning the msgid has
      changed and needs some verification
      [hannosch]

    - Added optional allcomments argument and get_original() method
      These are used in the latest PloneTranslations tests to compare
      the original value of a msgid with the msgstr
      [hannosch]

    - Set chart width to 1000px. Plone has too many translations ;)
      [hannosch]

    - Included a new option to scan python scripts for messages.
      Currently it looks for the _(), translate() and uranslate()
      functions. It is based on pygettext.py from Python and some
      ideas taken from Zope's extract.py.
      [hannosch]

    - catalog.py (POWriter._print_entry): Added a second # to "English
      translation" lines so that those lines don't get written out twice.
      Which happens because we try to preserve comments.
      [dn]
