** TODO **

- Assume a domain called "default" if the i18n:domain attribute is not present.

- Produce translation ids from the content of tags when no id is given, e.g.:

   <span i18n:translate=''>
     <span tal:replace='here/name' i18n:name='name' /> was born in
     <span tal:replace='here/country_of_birth' i18n:name='country' />.
   </span>

  should produce the msg id "${name} was born in ${country}."

-  PTReader should provide line and column numbers when printing messages.

-  PTReader should use twisted.web.microdom so that it does not bail out so
   easily. More specifically it not require < and & to be escaped inside
   attribute values.

-  untranslated.py does not handle xml namespaces, e.g. it just looks for an
   attribute 'i18n:translate' even if the tag itself is in the i18n namespace.

-  Sometimes untranslated.py spits out errors that are actually warnings. That
   happens for tal:replace and metal:use-macro tags that contain other tags.
