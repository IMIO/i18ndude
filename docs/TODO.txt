** TODO **

- Tests needs to be written for more than catalog.py

- Main i18ndude script needs to be refactored and fewer options.

- Assume a domain called "default" if the i18n:domain attribute is not present.

- untranslated.py does not handle xml namespaces, e.g. it just looks for an
  attribute 'i18n:translate' even if the tag itself is in the i18n namespace.

- Sometimes untranslated.py spits out errors that are actually warnings. That
  happens for tal:replace and metal:use-macro tags that contain other tags.
