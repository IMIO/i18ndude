	* tagged and released 0.6

2005-06-24 Hanno Schlichting <schlichting at bakb dot org>

	* pystring: add 'addPortalMessage' to the list of python functions whose
	argument should be translated. This allows to catch the new-style portal-
	messages in Plone 2.1 to be automagically extracted

2005-06-14 Jodok Batlogg <batlogg at solution2u dot net>

	* tagging 0.5

2005-06-13 Hanno Schlichting <schlichting at bakb dot org>

	* as html-entities in msgstr's are bad, don't provide them in the original
	comments. this has confused translators.

2005-06-11 Hanno Schlichting <schlichting at bakb dot org>

	* untranslated.py: Added a new handler available through a command line
	switch, generally ignore text in script and style tags

2005-06-02 Hanno Schlichting <schlichting at bakb dot org>

	* Fixed whitespace error in generation of #, fuzzy comments

2005-05-29 Hanno Schlichting <schlichting at bakb dot org>

	* i18ndude now takes a second pot to merge in the merge and rebuild-pot
	commands, this is useful if you have both a manual.pot and a generated.pot

	* catalog.py (MessageCatalog) added a new method addToSameFileName() which
	adds in a msgid but adds the excerpt to an existing filename occurrence
	This is used in i18ngenerator.py of PloneTranslations to add in actions
	like "Edit" as msgids and adds all types these are definied to the same
	occurrence rather than generating a new one for each type

	* catalog.py (POWriter.write) takes a new argument noMoreComments that
	supresses the "## xx More..." comments

2005-05-28 Hanno Schlichting <schlichting at bakb dot org>

	* Also fill in the Original comments when parsing i18n:attributes
	This allows for efficient handling of named i18n:attributes

2005-05-27 Hanno Schlichting <schlichting at bakb dot org>

	* Refactored the English Translation stuff and renamed it to Original

	* When syncing po-files the old and new original comments are compared and
	the msgid is set to fuzzy if these aren't the same, meaning the msgid has
	changed and needs some verification

2005-05-22 Hanno Schlichting <schlichting at bakb dot org>

	* Added optional allcomments argument and get_original() method
	These are used in the latest PloneTranslations tests to compare
	the original value of a msgid with the msgstr

2005-05-21 Hanno Schlichting <schlichting at bakb dot org>

	* Set chart width to 1000px. Plone has too many translations ;)

2005-05-16 Hanno Schlichting <schlichting at bakb dot org>

	* Included a new option to scan python scripts for messages.
        Currently it looks for the _(), translate() and uranslate()
        functions. It is based on pygettext.py from Python and some
        ideas taken from Zope's extract.py.

2005-05-09  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt at web.de>

	* catalog.py (POWriter._print_entry): Added a second # to "English
	translation" lines so that those lines don't get written out twice.
	Which happens because we try to preserve comments.
	
2005-05-08 Jodok Batlogg <batlogg at solution2u dot net>

	* moved from cvs.sf.net to svn.plone.org. history was NOT migrated
          check http://cvs.sf.net/viewcvs.py/plone-i18n/i18ndude for older 
          revisions

2005-05-07 Hanno Schlichting <schlichting at bakb dot org>

	* Include msgstr in POT-file as an additional comment
	"## English translation:"

	* Fixed issue where the header information of an empty manual pot
	were not applied to the product.pot

2005-01-26  Daniel Nouri  <dpunktnpunkt at web.de>

	* common.py (prepare_xml): Applied patch by Roel van der Steen.
	(#982527)

2004-01-14  Daniel Nouri  <daniel@con-fuse.org>

	* catalog.py (PTReader._make_msgstr): Include msgstr in POT-file.

	* i18ndude.py (filter_isfile): Now accepts directories on command-line.

2003-12-20  Daniel Nouri  <daniel.nouri@con-fuse.org>

	* untranslated.py (_severity): Improved namespace awareness.

2003-12-12  Daniel Nouri  <daniel.nouri@con-fuse.org>

	* i18ndude.py: Added extract-literals and filter commands.

	* catalog.py: MessageCatalog uses an ordered dictionary now. POWriter
	can now write ids in the order of the source's appearance.

	* odict.py: Ordered dictionary implementation.

2003-11-07  Daniel Nouri  <daniel@con-fuse.org>

	* i18ndude.py: Some renaming and added --create option for
	'rebuild-pot' command.

2003-11-03 Daniel Nouri  <daniel.nouri@con-fuse.org>

	* catalog.py: Added update-pot command. It needs heavy testing now!

2003-11-03 Daniel Nouri  <daniel.nouri@con-fuse.org>

	* i18ndude.py: i18ndude now knows 'find-untranslated' (which used to be
	the only action in the versions before), 'update-pot' (not done) and
	'sync' commands. For a usage summary see "i18ndude --help".

	Note that 'sync' has only been tested sparsely. Please report any bugs
	or suggestions that you might have. When writing out the .po- file,
	sync orders entries by msgid, where 'literal' msgids come last.
	Therefore it is not possible to keep up with comments that are of
	chronological nature. ERASE THESE from the pot.

	I feel :( and *ugh* about the fact that there are actually two other
	projects that also aim to provide po-convenience. Sorry for the
	headbutt.

	* untranslated.py: Added. The contents were part of i18ndude.py before.

	* catalog.py: Added. Contains classes MessageCatalog, POParser,
	POWriter. PTReader, for reading from pts into a MessageCatalog is yet
	to be implemented. (See docstrings)

2003-10-20  Daniel Nouri  <daniel@tijuana>

	* i18ndude.py (SilentHandler.endDocument): SilentHandler does not
	mention parsed documents that had no errors or warnings anymore.

2003-10-11  Daniel Nouri  <daniel.nouri@con-fuse.org>

	* i18ndude.py: Applied patch from Jeroen Janssen, fixing a Python2.3
	related bug.

2003-10-03  Daniel Nouri  <daniel.nouri@con-fuse.org>

	* i18ndude.py: Now has a --silent mode (use it as the first argument)
	so that it reports a summary only.

2003-10-01 22:42  Daniel Nouri <daniel.nouri@con-fuse.org>

    * i18ndude.py: Comments marked by tal:condition="nothing" are now ignored.
